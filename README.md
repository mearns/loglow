## Overview

Loggers have names, which are actually heirarchical paths, typically beginning with the package name or the package
scope and package name, and then usually refined by module and function names. Path heirarchies are delimited by
slashes, like "@loglow/core/config/loadConfig".

Logging configuration is specified by path and applies to all loggers which include that path as a prefix. For instance,
configuration set for "@loglow/core" will apply to a logger named "@loglow/core" and also to all loggers whose names start
with "@loglow/core/". Note that it only applies to full path prefixes, e.g., it would not apply to a logger named
"@loglow/coretastic". Additionally, a root configuration applies to all loggers.

Configuration is defined by configurators: functions that take a configuration object and return a configuration object.
All configurators that apply to a given logger are applied sequentially from shortest path to longest, starting with a
default configuration object to which the root configurator is applied. The resulting configuration is passed to the next
configurator, etc.

The resulting configuration object is called an _implementation_. It's created when a logger is needed and cached until
a configurator that applies to the implementation is changed.

A logger itself, the thing that is used for adding log entries, is mostly just a fa√ßade around some functions that load
the required implementation and use it to generate the entry. Loggers are stateless; you can get one by name when you need it,
reuse or throw it away and get it back when you want it again. Because of the separation of loggers and implementations,
getting a logger is cheap.

## Usage Patterns

Libraries should typically get the loggers they want by name, but not do any configuration. An application will set the configuration
at startup for whatever loggers they care to configure. This is typically done at load time for the top-level entrypoint of the
application, before any other modules are loaded so that the configuration is in place before any loggers are used. For good measure,
the application can get an exclusive configuration lock which will prevent any other code from configuring logging. Something like
https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html#async_hooks_class_asynclocalstorage should help where available.

## Configuration Concepts

There are three ways to configure loggers:

-   Enabled or disabled
-   Middleware
-   Decorators

In additional, you configuring _logging_ by adding subscribers.

The master can lock down everything except decorators. Decorators are useful within a module to create a coherent story without
having to pass a lot of things around. Note that it doesn't directly solve the issue of interleaved executions where perhaps the
same function is being invoked as part of several different concurrent stories and logging things: they will still need a way to
know what story they're part of. However, naming loggers with a unique story-id means they you only need to pass that story-id
through to everything (there's a reasonable chance they would need that anyway), and they can then ask for the correct logger.

### Logger Middleware

Middleware is used to transform log entries before they are actually added to the log. For each log entry, the configured
middleware layers are invoked in a chain: the first is invoked with the log entry and a function for continuing the chain.
The middleware is responsible for invoking the next layer with a log entry; typically one derived from the one that was passed
in. Or, it can filter out the log entry by invoking the provided `terminate` hook.

Common use cases include:

-   Filters that exclude log entries from being added to the log based on their contents.
-   Log rewriters to catch logs you don't have control over (e.g., from a third-party library) and transforming them into
    something more useful to you.
